# Facial Recognition App

## Overview

The Facial Recognition App is a project aimed at recognizing faces of users using TensorFlow for computer vision. The application is built using Kivy for the user interface and interaction, with NumPy for efficient array operations.


## Technologies Used

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open-source machine learning library.
- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/): An open-source Python framework for developing multi-touch applications.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A library for mathematical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install required packages:

  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow  
  pip install  kivy
  pip install  numpy
  pip install cv2
